# Text_Augmentation
I have written a Python script that reads a CSV file containing a series of strings, one by one. For each string, the script generates new sentences with the same meaning as the input and adds them to the same CSV file.
To achieve this, I have used a combination of Python libraries such as pandas, nltk, and regex. These libraries provide powerful tools for working with CSV files, natural language processing, and regular expressions.

The process of creating new sentences with the same meaning as the input involves analyzing the syntax and semantics of the original sentence and then using various techniques to generate new sentences that convey the same meaning. For example, I have used techniques such as paraphrasing, sentence splitting, or synonym replacement to generate new sentences.

Once the new sentences have been generated, I append them to the same CSV file as the original string. This process involves creating a new column in the CSV file to store the new sentences.

Overall, I believe that the code I have written is a powerful tool for generating new sentences with the same meaning as existing strings in a CSV file. It has many potential applications, such as data augmentation for natural language processing tasks or content creation for marketing or advertising.
